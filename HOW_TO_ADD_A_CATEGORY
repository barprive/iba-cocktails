# Add a new category to categories.json
To add a new category you need to edit just one file: categories.json.
You add an entry at the end of the file by copying the last entry.

# Generating all databases
Once you have done that, run 'npm start' in the console and it will generate all the files needed as gen_*.

# Commit your work
Commit your changes with Git.
git add --all
git commit -m "Update categories"
git push

# Update backend databases
Copy gen_categories.json to backend/database.
Commit your work with Git.
git add --all
git commit -m "Update categories"
git push

# Deploy into production
Ask Jerome to do it as he has access to the server.

# Add files to Algolia
Now go to Algolia and edit the index categories:
- open categories index
- clear whole index
- upload JSON file
- choose gen_algolia_categories.json
