# Add a new cocktail to recipes.json
To add a new cocktail you need to edit just one file: recipes.json.
You add an entry at the end of the file by copying the last entry and incrementing the id.

# Generating all databases
Once you have done that, run 'npm start' in the console and it will generate all the files needed as gen_*.

# Commit your work
Check there are no ingredient duplicates in gen_ingredients.json and commit your changes with Git.
git add --all
git commit -m "Update cocktails"
git push

# Update backend databases
Copy gen_cocktails.json gen_ingredients.json gen_categories.json to backend/database.
Commit your work with Git.
git add --all
git commit -m "Update cocktails"
git push

# Deploy into production
Ask Jerome to do it as he has access to the server.

# Add files to Algolia
Now go to Algolia.
Open each index, clear it and add new file to it.
Example for categories:
- open category index
- clear whole index
- upload JSON file
- choose gen_algolia_categories.json
